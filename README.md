# Tableau-Analysis
This is work that I did in Tableau during my Data Technician Skills Bootcamp.

## Project 1: My first visualisations

This project used the EMSI_JobChange_UK dataset: [EMSI_JobChange_UK.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20266807/EMSI_JobChange_UK.xlsx)

Here are the resulting screen shots:

Some of the insights I had from this were:

World music has the longest average length, whereas Children’s music has the shortest.
Pop was most popular, but Children’s music was least popular.
Duration and Popularity have no clear correlation.
Raggaeton was the loudest on average, while Classical was the quietest.
Pop had the most popular artists, however A Capella has the least popular.

Project 3: Health data
This project used the data already incorporated into this Tableau workbook on Health Survey here.

Here is a screenshot of the dashboard created:
